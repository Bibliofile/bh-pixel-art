# Pixel Art By Number

> [Try it out!](tool/index.html)

## What is this?

This is a tool which can help you make pixel art in The Blockheads by taking an image and turning it into a template similar to a paint by number kit.

## How do I use it?

First, find an image you want to make a pixel art out of. Next, decide how big of a project you want. The script will resize your image to make sure it fits within the bounds of the dimensions you set. Then click Go! You will be shown an image with each pixel given a number and a recipe list of the in game pigments to use to make each number. Fill this in in game and your friends will soon refer to you as a pixel art master!

## Who made it?

The idea for this project came from Skeeve on [The Blockheads Forum](https://forums.theblockheads.net). Skeeve's excel file worked, but was slow and required a windows PC. Bibliophile decided to make a derivative web based version which works on most modern browsers.

## How does it work?

The tool works by first resizing your image to fit within the provided dimensions. Next, it looks at each color in the image and picks the closest paint color to that color. It then recolors the image with the closest paint color and displays the image, showing the recipe for each color on the side. If you are
